The goal for this site is to increase the value of the Liferay brand. To do that, we need to accomplish three things: Improve execution Increase consistency Build awareness For more on improvements to execution, read our brand update (WIP). We’re providing a centralized repository of knowledge and a shared library of assets to make things more accessible to everyone to increase consistency. As we execute on those two points, we empower everyone to more effectively build awareness. Our Approach Every great brand is built on a strong foundation &mdash; principles, values, an inspiring mission, etc. Here at Liferay we have all of those in spades &mdash; an aspirational mission, concrete values, and developing principles. Design has grown organically here, siloed by region and function &mdash; up until fairly recently we had never all been in the same place, and many of us had never met in person or otherwise! We conducted a Design Principles Workshop, where we all collaborated on drafting principles and shared them with each other. This was a great start, and really amazing to see the amount of common principles that we felt were part of our experience here at Liferay. The challenge was to take all of the different artifacts, guidelines, and philosophies that we had accrued over time and space and document and work at refining them along the way. As you can imagine, this is a long process &mdash; and it's still very much in the works, see our Principles page for the current status, and please contribute comments, thoughts, and ideas in our Brand Sprint Results slides.

Candid &mdash; We make great software that helps people make use of technology to help companies achieve success. Humble &mdash; Help people reach their full potential to serve others. Where Does This Come From? To start this process, we held a Brand Sprint with Bryan Cheung to get the 30,000-foot view of Liferay, gather and prioritize our values and audiences, and translate subjective concepts about personality into some objective qualities that we can start to render. In preparation for this, we surveyed a small, but diverse, focus group comprised of a wide variety of departments and regions &mdash; in order to come to the sprint with a good idea of where these people felt that we were. One of the most important takeaways from the sprint, is that we need to continue to create open and direct lines of communication with our customers. Long-term we want to be an ecosystem partner with them, anticipating and meeting their needs, making technology useful for them. If the slides above don't render, log into your Liferay Google Account. That’s Great and All — but What Does That Look Like? Our values are reflected in all areas of Liferay and the guiding principles by which we make decisions — from hiring, to engineering, to supporting — are all informed by these values. Our personality reflects our values — We are confident that business done well can improve the world, candid about how our technology enables companies to achieve success, and humble in our approach to helping people reach their full potential to serve others. We have a candid, humble voice in our marketing and sales materials — to support and balance this, our visuals are confident, bold, and vibrant — but not overly so. We are expressive, playful, and aiming for mass appeal while still walking the line between conventional and disruptive, slightly more young and innovative than mature and classic.

Color plays a significant role in defining and supporting the visual identity by bringing harmony and enhancing communication. Liferay Blue One of the most consistent aspects of our brand is our committment to blue. While it has varied and evolved over the years, blue is one of the more lasting parts of our brand. We have a new primary brand blue (#0B63CE) — use it thoughtfully. If you're using color on a website, app, or other digital medium, check out our digital color resources &mdash; if you need to buy a giant blue rug or give a pen vendor a color swatch, see our print color files.

The style is meant to be more playful and approachable. The lack of defined facial features is to create a purposefully relatable experience for the viewer. Characteristics Common characteristics and motifs throughout the illustrations are the junction of human forms with technology and also simplified metaphors related to the content. Uses These illustrations have three uses: they provide a more approachable and engaging experience for the user, they provide contextual navigation clues to where the user is on the site, and they supplement and bolster the section copy. What to Avoid It’s important to avoid using an illustration INSTEAD of text content. The illustrations are meant to support textual messaging on the page, not the other way around. Avoid having copy interfere or obstruct the illustration in any way. Avoid altering the colors of the illustrations or converting them to grayscale. Do not cut off parts of the illustration -- they must be viewed as they were originally intended. Assets (see Figma assets) Colors & Color Schemes (in Figma) Textures A grain texture is to be applied to shadows where seen fit. The grain can be applied to both mid and dark shadow shapes. It is up to the designer to make sure whatever choice they make creates a harmonious experience within the illustration. Figures Figures Rules: Figures are to be presented as fairly flat with some depth. The depth is created by adding darker tones to the legs or arms that are further away from our user. Depth is also created with organic shadow shapes on our figures. Although the figure shapes should be fairly flat with some curves, the shadows should be created to reflect true body curvature. Shadows should be simplified to create larger shape mass. Materials Any and all materials can be used in these illustrations. It is up to the designer to use the style rules to create those materials. Composition (bg, mid-ground, foreground) Where possible, the designer should create three layers to each illustration. In each illustration there should be a background, a mid-ground, and a foreground. The background is typically the atmosphere -- in most cases this can be created with an organic shape and clouds to illustrate a sky backdrop. The mid-ground will be our environment. This is where most of the illustration should live. It should answer 1) where are we? 2) why are we here? 3) what is happening? The foreground should ideally support our illustration’s main character and action. The main focus and attention should be on the foreground element(s). Rule of Thirds It is up to the designer to respect the rule of thirds when planning an illustration. The main Ratios & Proportions Ideal illustrations should be close to square in ratio. Unless a specific spot illustrations calls for full-width sizing then the designer should aim for a square ratio. Focal Points The foreground, with primary action, should be the focal point of the illustration. Metaphors & Message It’s important to keep the illustration’s metaphor fairly simple. It should reflect the core essence of the messaging but should not attempt to incorporate every sub-concept of the page copy. The illustration is meant to offer an idea, not replace copy and messaging. Lighting The global lighting angle is somewhat flexible. The ideal lighting is either a direct 90 degree angle or any angle between 90 and 135.
